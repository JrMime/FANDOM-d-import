# Customize Discussions
Imports custom JavaScript and CSS into all Discussions on [Fandom](https://c.fandom.com) via a Chrome/Firefox Extension. Documentation is available [here](https://dev.fandom.com/CustomizeDiscussions).

## Note to reviewers
Aside from custom JavaScript and CSS that users supply for importing, this extension also imports jQuery version 3.3.1, whose minified code can be found [here](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js), non-minified code can be found [here](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.js) and the source code can be found in the [jquery/jquery 3.x-stable](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/3.x-stable) branch on GitHub.

You will be provided with credentials to the [CustomizeDiscussions account on Fandom](https://c.fandom.com/Special:Contribs/CustomizeDiscussions). Upon loading the extension without further configuration, its [global Discussions JavaScript page](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/User:CustomizeDiscussions/globalDiscussions.js) should load on any instance of Fandom Discussions, for example, on [Fandom Developers Wiki](https://dev.fandom.com/f).
